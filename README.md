# ðŸš€ Welcome

This repository is a part of a proof-of-concept (poc) to investigate how we can drive a configuration for OpenNMS Horizon/Meridian driven through git.
The goals for the poc:

* Challenges about dealing with immutable and mutable configuration files
* What is required to initialize configurations running in a container environment
* How can we leverage from overlaying and templating configuration files in our container images using Confd and overlay file conventions

This repository is used in the https://github.com/opennms-forge/gitops-opennms which has a sample container stack that uses this config repository.
